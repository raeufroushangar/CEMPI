# CEMPI (Contextual Encoding of Mutations Positional Impact)

CEMPI is a repository for implementing algorithms related to the contextual encoding of mutations and their positional impact in genomic sequences.

## Project Description

CEMPI integrates partitioning and clustering algorithms to capture mutation positions (bases and regions) and their impact across DNA/RNA/protein sequences. The repository serves as a toolkit for bioinformaticians and researchers studying evolutionary genomics.

## Directory Structure

- `src`: Contains source code files.

## System Requirements

- macOS 10.15 or higher / Windows 10 or higher / Linux
- Python 3.9 or higher installed
- pip3 24
- *May work with similar versions.

**Installation Instructions:**
