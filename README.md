# CEMPI (Contextual Encoding of Mutations Positional Impact)

CEMPI is a repository for implementing algorithms and tools related to the contextual encoding of mutations and their positional impact in genomic sequences.

## Project Description

CEMPI integrates partitioning and clustering algorithms to capture mutation positions (bases and regions) and their impact across genomic sequences. The repository serves as a toolkit for bioinformaticians and researchers studying evolutionary genomics.

## Directory Structure

- `src`: Contains source code files.
